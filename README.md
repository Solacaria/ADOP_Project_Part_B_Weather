<H1>Weather information application</H1>

<H2>Basic functions</H2>
<P>This app displays basic weather information about the pre-selected area. Includes Temperature, windspeed and humidity.</P>
<P>Flyout menu in the top-left corner, lets you pick a city.</P>
<P>Background shows a picture of the selected city.</P>

<H2>Why did you make this?</H2>
<p>This was an assignment for a school project. The objective was to get the API-key to work with the help of classes and then present the data</p>
<p>Using MAUI instead of console application to display the data.</p>
<p>To showcase my newly learned skills in C# and .NET frameworks. Learning to handle a project spread out into lots of files.</p>

<H2>Can i use your API?</H2>
<P>No. The API is free to get,  <a href="https://openweathermap.org">just click here</a> and make a free account.</P>

<H2>Where do i put the API key?</H2>
<P>Go into the "Services" folder, open up "OpenWeatherService.cs" and it should be at the top as an empty string. </P>
